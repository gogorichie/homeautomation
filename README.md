# Home Automation Repository


Welcome to the Home Automation Repository! This repository contains the configurations and tools I use to manage and monitor my home automation setup. With the help of Grafana dashboards, Ansible playbooks, diagrams.net files, and Telegraf, I've created an efficient and reliable system for controlling various aspects of my home.

## Introduction
Home automation has become an essential part of modern living, providing convenience, energy efficiency, and security. This repository aims to share my home automation setup and configuration so that others can benefit from it or contribute to its improvement. Feel free to explore the contents and adapt them to suit your own needs.

## Features
- Grafana Dashboards: I have created Grafana dashboards to visualize various metrics and data collected from the devices in my home automation network. These dashboards provide real-time insights into the performance and status of connected devices.

- Ansible Playbooks: The Ansible playbooks in this repository allow for automated provisioning and configuration management of devices and services in my home automation setup. They help ensure consistency and ease of deployment.

- Diagrams.net Files: I have documented my home automation architecture and network layout using diagrams.net (formerly known as draw.io) files. These diagrams provide a clear understanding of the different components and their interactions.

- Telegraf Integration: Telegraf is used to collect data from sensors and devices throughout the home automation system. This data is then stored and visualized through Grafana

Thank you for using my Home Automation Repository! I hope this helps you create a powerful, efficient, and convenient home automation system. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy automating!
